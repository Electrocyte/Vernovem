### Character Concept
Petalwin emerged from the Tecoma Tree of Rosadake during dusk, their bark-like skin a rich amber hue with golden veins running throughout. Perpetually curious and philosophical, they have dedicated their life to preserving the wisdom of Verdancy through stories and songs. As a respected historian of Verdant Orders, they believe Alarak's controversial methods threaten the core principles of balanced growth. They accompany him not as an ally, but as a witness who must document what occurs and determine if there is truth in his radical approach.

### Backstory Notes
Petalwin is a respected historian among the Verdant Orders, known for preserving the wisdom of past masters through song and story. Their philosophical nature led them to study the spiritual underpinnings of Verdancy, believing the cycle of growth and decay represents a divine balance that must be preserved.

When Alarak began speaking of "necessary endings" and "culling for greater growth," Petalwin publicly opposed his teachings as heretical distortions of Verdant principles. However, the Cyclewardens insisted that someone of Petalwin's scholarly reputation must accompany Alarak to witness and document his controversial approach.

Reluctantly agreeing, Petalwin views this journey as both a duty and an opportunity to either disprove Alarak's methods or, more unsettlingly, to discover if there might be wisdom in his radical perspective. They carry the weight of responsibility to their Order, knowing their testimony will influence how Alarak's actions are judged in Verdant history.

### Roleplaying Notes
- Speaks formally, often quoting ancient Verdant masters to support their points
- Carefully documents everything they witness in an ongoing chronicle
- Initially dismissive of Alarak's methods, but intellectually honest enough to consider evidence
- Embodies the tenets of the Oath of the Ancients, striving to preserve light and life
- Communicates with plants respectfully, treating them as distant cousins
- Often recites Tales from Beyond that seem eerily relevant to current situations
- Struggles with cognitive dissonance when evidence contradicts their established beliefs
- Golden veins in their bark-like skin pulse with light when channeling divine energy
