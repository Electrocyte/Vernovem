# Thorn Blackbark
## Level 8 Nightborn Vernovem - Withering Blade
*Gloomstalker Ranger (5) / Withering Vanguard Multiclass (3)*

*Medium Plant/Fey, Lawful Neutral*

**Background:** Soldier - A tactical operative trained to eliminate threats to the natural cycle.

### Character Concept
Thorn emerged from the Tecoma Tree of Rosadake under moonless night skies, their bark-like skin darkened to near black with thorny protrusions that extend when they channel their magic. The Cyclewardens identified their innate connection to death's necessity in the natural cycle and trained them as part of the Withering Vanguard. Now a skilled operative who unerringly identifies and eliminates corruption, Thorn has been tasked with monitoring Alarak's expedition to ensure it doesn't violate fundamental verdant principles.

### Backstory Notes
The Cyclewardens noticed Thorn's unusually strong connection to the principles of necessary pruning shortly after their emergence from the Tecoma Tree of Rosadake. When other Vernovem recoiled from the concept of controlled destruction, Thorn understood intuitively that death was merely another face of growth.

Recruited into the secretive Withering Vanguard, Thorn has spent decades eliminating corrupted growth and invasive species that threaten the balance of natural ecosystems. Though their methods appear ruthless to other Verdant orders, the Cyclewardens recognize the necessity of their role.

When rumors of Alarak's expedition to the Cursed Coalforest reached the Cyclewardens, they dispatched Thorn with dual purposes: to observe this controversial approach to stagnation and, if necessary, to ensure that Alarak does not unleash something worse than the corruption he seeks to address.

### Roleplaying Notes
- Speaks rarely and directly, with little patience for philosophical debate
- Constantly evaluates surroundings for signs of corruption or imbalance
- Moves with predatory grace, their thorny protrusions extending subtly when they sense danger
- Views culling as a respectful necessity rather than a cruel act
- Has a deep reverence for the complete cycle of life, including death
- Skeptical of Alarak's methods but respects his apparent understanding of decay's necessity
- Their bark-like skin temporarily withers in patterns when using their Withering Vanguard abilities
