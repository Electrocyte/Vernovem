# Echo Nevermold
## Level 8 Noonborn Vernovem - Lost Sapling
*Phantom Rogue (5) / Seedspeaker Initiate (3)*

*Medium Plant/Fey, Chaotic Neutral*

**Background:** Outlander - Someone who grew in isolation, disconnected from typical Vernovem society.

### Character Concept
Echo emerged from a peculiar fruit pod that grew at an unusual distance from the Tecoma Tree of Rosadake, bathed in perpetual noon light. Their bark-like skin has never shown signs of aging or decay, appearing perpetually new with an unsettling perfection. Seeds planted near them flourish with incredible vitality but never complete their cycle - fruits remain eternally ripe, flowers perpetually bloom. Born with an unbalanced connection to Verdancy that emphasizes growth without decay, Echo seeks to understand what it means to be "complete" - both for themself and for the life they influence.

### Special Abilities

**Watcher Between:** When using Wails from the Grave or Potential Dialogue, you sometimes glimpse alternate futures or past iterations of the target. Roll a d20. On a roll of 18-20, you learn additional information about a significant turning point in the target's existence - a moment when its path could have drastically changed.

**Eternal Bloom (Unique Trait):** Flora within 10 feet of you doesn't wilt, decay, or die naturally. This preservation effect fades gradually after you leave, with plants returning to their natural cycles within 1d4 days. This trait sometimes manifests in disturbing ways, such as fruits that remain ripe despite being picked months ago or flowers that cannot release their seeds because they never wither.

- Cloak woven from leaves that remain perpetually fresh
- Collection of perfectly preserved specimens that should have decayed long ago
- Small pouch of seeds from plants that grow rapidly but never complete their cycle
- Journal documenting observations of normal life cycles (that Echo cannot experience)
- Token from a Cyclenwarden who first noticed Echo's unusual nature
- Set of thieves' tools with handles made from Echo's own bark

### Backstory Notes
Echo's fruit pod developed at an unusual distance from the Tecoma Tree of Rosadake, exposed to magical energies that warped their connection to Verdancy. Upon emergence, they displayed an unprecedented affinity for growth but seemed completely disconnected from the concepts of decay, withering, and renewal.

Plants around Echo flourish with extraordinary vitality, but remain trapped in perpetual bloom - never releasing seeds, never returning nutrients to the soil. Other Vernovem found this disturbing, leading to Echo's isolation and eventual departure from their grove.

Wandering the wilds, Echo discovered the Seedspeakers, who recognized their unique ability to perceive potential futures but were concerned by their fundamental disconnection from the complete cycle. A Cyclenwarden recommended they seek out the controversial Alarak, suggesting his understanding of "necessary endings" might help Echo find balance.

Now Echo travels with Alarak, hoping to understand what it means to be "complete" in a cycle they have never fully experienced. They are both fascinated and frightened by the possibility of discovering what their existence lacks.

### Roleplaying Notes
- Speaks with a voice that never wavers or changes pitch, like a perfectly sustained note
- Moves with an unnatural grace that seems too perfect, lacking the natural variations of living things
- Observes normal life cycles with intense curiosity, taking detailed notes on decay processes
- Occasionally has disturbing moments of insight about others' fates, which they share without understanding social boundaries
- Has never experienced pain, illness, or deterioration, making them sometimes coldly analytical about others' suffering
- Leaves a subtle trail of over-flourishing plants wherever they linger
- Struggles to understand concepts like "letting go" or "moving on" that require acceptance of endings
- Their seed-like growths rustle intensely when detecting significant potential futures nearby
