# Thorne Goldenbloom
## Level 8 Dawnborn Vernovem - Bloomcaller Adept
*Circle of Wildgrowth Druid (5) / Sorcerer with Verdancy Origin (3)*

*Medium Plant/Fey, Neutral Good*

**Background:** Sage - A scholar of botanical growth patterns who has spent decades cataloging the various manifestations of Verdancy.

### Character Concept
Thorne emerged from the Tecoma Tree of Rosadake during dawn's first light, their bark-like skin adorned with perpetually budding flowers that bloom brilliantly when casting magic. Once a promising student who documented the accelerated growth techniques of the Bloomcallers, they have found their own abilities plateauing in recent years. The very Order that taught them to nurture rapid flourishing has become stagnant in their approach. Desperate to rediscover the vital spark of growth within themself, Thorne has agreed to accompany Alarak on this dangerous journey.

### Backstory Notes
Thorne has documented countless flourishing techniques of the Bloomcallers, yet recently discovered their own magic has become predictable and routine. The vibrant colors of their blossoms have dulled, and their accelerations lack the vitality they once possessed.

Fellow Bloomcallers insist this is merely a phase, but Thorne feels a deeper stagnation within the Order itself. When they heard Alarak was seeking companions for a journey to study a "garden that had forgotten death," they recognized an opportunity to witness the cycle from a new perspective.

Though many Bloomcallers warned against following the controversial Alarak, Thorne believes only by confronting the consequences of unbalanced growth can they rediscover their own path to Blossoming.

### Roleplaying Notes
- Speaks with a rhythmic cadence that fluctuates like a plant swaying in the breeze
- Constantly examines plants encountered during travel, often absentmindedly accelerating their growth
- Carries a journal filled with pressed leaves and flowers from significant moments
- Struggles with the concept that destruction might be necessary for creation
- Their petals visibly brighten in color when excited or casting powerful magic
- Has begun questioning the Bloomcallers' focus on beauty over sustainability
